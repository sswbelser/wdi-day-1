	<h2>Interesting Things From the <a href="https://medium.com/@cecilycarver/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code-565fc9dcb329">Article</a></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>It's comforting to know that programmers of all levels frequently fail when they think they've finished their code. It's such a common occurance, that how you respond to the failures is one of the most important components of programming</li>
		<li>It's interesting that there is fragmentation between coders; like through statements like "if you use HTML, you're not a coder; real coders use C". I suppose there are social stigmatisms, regardless of what industry you're working in</li>
		<li>It's interesting how important perseverance is while learning code. This is something that was covered extensively during the first day of WDI instruction, and it is nice to hear it authenticated by this reading's author. The author talked about how the online tutorials for code will help you breeze through the beginner segments, but there will be a very steep learning curve; once you try to start working on a functional project, you hit a brick wall and aren't sure how to proceed. I personally have completed several online tutorials for several coding languages before coming to WDI, and I will continue to apply myself both through this program's assignments, and through whatever pet projects I come up with. Practice makes perfect</li>
